  "description": "This is a draft RDF vocabulary for representing spatial data sets in INSPIRE as RDF.  This vocabulary has been created using the [“Guidelines for the RDF encoding of spatial data”](http://inspire-eu-rdf.github.io/inspire-rdf-guidelines).\n\nThe use of RDF is optional and does not supersede or replace the requirements regarding encoding specified in Clause 9 of the INSPIRE Data Specifications.  This optional encoding is intended to support the e-government and open data community in Europe, which is increasingly looking at RDF to represent data.\n\nThis is a draft version.  It has limitations and is expected to contain errors.  Please report any issues or concerns in [GitHub](https://github.com/inspire-eu-rdf/inspire-rdf-vocabularies/issues).\n\nThis ontology contains classes and properties that have been derived from the INSPIRE Buildings 3D application schema.\n\nThe following properties have been encoded with global scope (see guidelines for further details):\n- `Building.geometry3DLoD1`\n- `Building.geometry3DLoD2`\n- `Building.geometry3DLoD3`\n- `Building.geometry3DLoD4`\n\nDuring the derivation, the following mappings, alignments, and omissions have been applied:\n- Mappings:\n  - `GM_MultiCurve` and `GM_MultiSurface` are mapped to the according classes from the [Simple Feature ontology](/ogc/sf).\n  - `GM_Solid` is mapped to the according class from the GML ontology.\n  - Properties `geometry2D` are mapped to the global property `geometry2D` from the buildings 2D ontology.\n  - Properties `horizontalGeometryReference`, `verticalGeometryEstimatedAccuracy`, and `horizontalGeometryReference` are mapped to the according global properties from the buildings base ontology.\n  - Properties `BuildingPart.geometry3DLoDX` (with X=1,2,3,4) are mapped to the global properties `geometry3DLoDX` (with X=1,2,3,4) from this ontology.\n\n- Alignments (through subsumption):\n  - Spatial object types are aligned with `gsp:Feature`.\n  - Properties with a geometry value type are aligned to `locn:geometry` and `gsp:hasGeometry`.\n\n- Omissions: none",
