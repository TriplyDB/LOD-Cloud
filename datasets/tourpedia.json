At the moment only eight places are covered: Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Dubai, London, Paris, Rome and Tuscany.  However, the idea is to extend the service to all the world.\n\nData are extracted from four social media: [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com), [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com), [Google Places](https://support.google.com/places) and [Booking](http://www.booking.com).  They were elaborated and integrated in order to build a unique catalogue.",
