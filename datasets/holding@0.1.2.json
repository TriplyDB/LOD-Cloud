  "description": "A vocabulary for describing (library) holdings.  The Holding Ontology deals with [items]() and their relations to agents and documents. An item is a copy or exemplar of a document. Items are also referred to as holdings, but a holding is moreover the description of an agents inventory and access information for the item. Items may further be connected to services, locations, and chronologies.",
