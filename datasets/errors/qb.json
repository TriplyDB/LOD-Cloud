  "description": "There are many situations where it would be useful to be able to publish multi-dimensional data, such as statistics, on the web in such a way that it can be linked to related data sets and concepts.  The Data Cube vocabulary provides a means to do this using the W3C [RDF](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/) (Resource Description Framework) standard.  The model underpinning the Data Cube vocabulary is compatible with the cube model that underlies [SDMX](http://sdmx.org/) (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange), an ISO standard for exchanging and sharing statistical data and metadata among organizations.  The Data Cube vocabulary is a core foundation which supports extension vocabularies to enable publication of other aspects of statistical data flows or other multi-dimensional data sets.",
