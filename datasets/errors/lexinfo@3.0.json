  "description": "LexInfo is an ontology that was defined during the Monnet Project to provide data categories for the [Lemon](http://lemon-model.net) model.  It has since since been updated with the new OntoLex-Lemon model of the [OntoLex community group](http://www.w3.org/community/ontolex).  LexInfo is now developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/ontolex/lexinfo).",
