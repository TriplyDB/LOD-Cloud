  "description": "An ontology of information objects, encodings and realizations, as a plugin to DOLCE-Ultralite (reusing mainly the `dul:expresses` and `dul:realizes` relations from it).  Several patterns are contained inside this ontology:\n  - encodings of information entities\n  - kinds of realizations (gestural motions, depictions, digital, multimedia, speech, etc.)\n  - combinatorial relations between information objects\n  - relations between formal expressions and generalized expressions (lexicalizations, formalizations)\n  - relations between formal expressions and their assignments in formal semantics\n  - relations between information objects and schemata (data structures, KOS, etc.)\n  - authorship\n  - kinds of linguistic objects\n  - copies, reproductions, etc.\n  - cultural combination of information objects (reuse, mixing, metaphorical blending).",
