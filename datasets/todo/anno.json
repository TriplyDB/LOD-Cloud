  "description": "Annotations are typically used to convey information about a resource or associations between resources.  Simple examples include a comment or tag on a single web page or image, or a blog post about a news article.\n\nThe Web Annotation Data Model specification describes a structured model and format to enable annotations to be shared and reused across different hardware and software platforms.  Common use cases can be modeled in a manner that is simple and convenient, while at the same time enabling more complex requirements, including linking arbitrary content to a particular data point or to segments of timed multimedia resources.\n\nThe specification provides a specific JSON format for ease of creation and consumption of annotations based on the conceptual model that accommodates these use cases, and the vocabulary of terms that represents it.",
