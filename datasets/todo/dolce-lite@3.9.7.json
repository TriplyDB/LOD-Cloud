  "description": "DOLCE is a foundational ontology developed and maintained by the [ISTC-CNR Laboratory for Applied Ontology](http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/).  It was originally developed within the [WonderWeb project](http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?ACTION=D&CALLER=PROJ_IST&RCN=60325) and was conceived as the first module of the WonderWeb Foundational Ontologies Library (WFOL) together with OCHRE and BFO.  DOLCE has remained stable after its first release in 2002/2003.  It is formally specified in first-order logic (FOL); its consistency has been proved by Oliver Kutz and Till Mossakowski (see [paper](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3754/3863)).",
