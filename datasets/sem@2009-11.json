  "description": "The Simple Event Model (SEM) is an ontology for modelling events.  Events are central elements in the representation of data from a variety of domains.  Examples of these domains are history, cultural heritage, geography and multimedia.  Event-centered modeling captures the time and place aspects of a domain.  In addition, events provide a way to describe complicated relations between people, places, actions and objects.",
