  "description": "ISO 19116:2004 specifies the data structure and content of an interface that permits communication between position-providing device(s) and position-using device(s) so that the position-using device(s) can obtain and unambiguously interpret position information and determine whether the results meet the requirements of the use.   A standardized interface of geographic information with position allows the integration of positional information from a variety of positioning technologies into a variety of geographic information applications, such as surveying, navigation and intelligent transportation systems.   ISO 19116:2004 will benefit a wide range of applications for which positional information is important.",
