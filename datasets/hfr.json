  "description": "The Hedge Fund Regulation Ontology is an operational application of the Financial Regulation Ontology.\n\nSemantic ComplianceÂ® is an ontological approach to regulatory reporting and oversight.  The ontology defines semantic rules to process regulatory compliance forms. The purpose is operational for:\n- Hedge Funds under the supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission is to fill out Form PF (private fund).\n- Regulators to extract Form PF filing data, transform and load it into semantic data structures.\n\nLatest update: The Hedge Fund Ontology will be a package in the Financial Industry Business Data Model (FIB-DM) in Q3, 2019.\n\nThe data triples in this ontology instantiate `FinRegOnt` classes `USC_Title`, `USC_Chapter`, `USC_Paragraph` etc. along with their properties.  They are loaded from `USC-2015-title12-chapter17`, reverse engineered from the original data in Office of the Law Revision Counsel XML file.",
