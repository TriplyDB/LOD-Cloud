  "description": "The Error Ontology is an unit test that allow to produce an inconsistent model if a particular (and incorrect) situation happens.\n\nIt works by means of a data property, ‘hasError’ that denies its usage for ant resource.  In fact, by defining its domain as “all those resource that don't have any hasErrorDescription assertion”, a resource that asserts having an error makes the ontology inconsistent.",
