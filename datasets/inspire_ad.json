  "description": "This is a draft RDF vocabulary for representing spatial data sets in INSPIRE as RDF.  This vocabulary has been created using the [“Guidelines for the RDF encoding of spatial data”](http://inspire-eu-rdf.github.io/inspire-rdf-guidelines).\n\nThe use of RDF is optional and does not supersede or replace the requirements regarding encoding specified in Clause 9 of the INSPIRE Data Specifications.  This optional encoding is intended to support the e-government and open data community in Europe, which is increasingly looking at RDF to represent data.\n\nThis is a draft version.  It has limitations and is expected to contain errors.  Please report any issues or concerns in [GitHub](https://github.com/inspire-eu-rdf/inspire-rdf-vocabularies/issues).\n\nThis ontology contains classes and properties that have been derived from the INSPIRE Addresses application schema.\n\nDuring the derivation, the following mappings, alignments, and omissions have been applied:\n- Mappings:\n  - Code list values are mapped to `skos:Concept`.\n  - The properties `beginLifespanVersion`, `endLifespanVersion`, `validFrom`, and `validTo` are mapped to the global properties defined by the base ontology.\n  - Geometry types are mapped to classes from the [Simple Feature ontology](/ogc/sf).\n\n- Alignments (through subsumption):\n  - Spatial object types are aligned with `gsp:Feature`.\n  - Type `Address` is aligned with `locn:Address`.\n  - Type `ThoroughfareNameValue` is aligned with `gn:GeographicalName`\n  - Properties of spatial object types with value type `GeographicalName` are aligned to property `locn:geographicName`.\n  - Properties with a geometry value type are aligned to locn:geometry and `gsp:hasDefaultGeometry`.\n\n- Omissions:\n  - Property `inspireId` is omitted. See the guidelines for further details.\n  - Property `ThoroughfareNameValue.name` is omitted.\n  - Type `AddressRepresentation` is omitted. Whenever this type is used as value type, then in the RDF encoding the RDF implementation of type `Address` is used.  For further details, see the guidelines.\n\n- Restructuring:\n  - Property `GeographicPosition.default` is transformed into a new property `defaultPosition` on class `Address`.",
