  "description": "The SPIN Modeling Vocabulary is a light-weight collection of RDF properties and classes to support the use of SPARQL to specify rules and logical constraints.  Based on an RDF representation of SPARQL queries, SPIN defines three class description properties: `spin:constraint` can be used to define conditions that all members of a class must fulfill.  `spin:rule` can be used to specify inference rules using SPARQL CONSTRUCTs and DELETE/INSERTs.  `spin:constructor` can be used to initialize new instances with default values.  In addition to these class description properties, SPIN provides a powerful meta-modeling capability that can be used to build your own modeling language and SPARQL extensions.  These meta-modeling features provide the ability to encapsulate reusable SPARQL queries into templates, and to derive new SPARQL functions as well as magic properties from other SPARQL queries and functions.\n\nThis document is part of the SPIN Submission which comprises three documents:- [SPIN - Overview and Motivation](https://www.w3.org/Submission/2011/SUBM-spin-overview-20110222/)\n- [SPIN - SPARQL Syntax](https://www.w3.org/Submission/2011/SUBM-spin-sparql-20110222/)\n- [SPIN - Modeling Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/Submission/2011/SUBM-spin-modeling-20110222/)\n\nEarlier versions of the SPIN specification have been published by the informal SPIN working group at <http://spinrdf.org>\n\nBy publishing this document, W3C acknowledges that the [Submitting Members](http://www.w3.org/Submission/2011/02/) have made a formal Submission request to W3C for discussion.
