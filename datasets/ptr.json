  "description": "Vocabulary for representing pointers ― entities that permit identifying a portion or segment of a piece of content ― making use of the [Resource Description Framework](/w3c/rdf) (RDF).  It also describes a number of specific types of pointers that permit portions of a document to be referred to in different ways.  When referring to a specific part of, say, a piece of web content, it is useful to be able to have a consistent manner by which to refer to a particular segment of a web document, to have a variety of ways by which to refer to that same segment, and to make the reference robust in the face of changes to that document.  This specification is part of the [Evaluation And Report Language](/w3c/earl) (EARL) but can be reused in other contexts too.",
