  "description": "This vocabulary defines a set of terms for describing changes to resource descriptions.\n\nIt introduces the notion of a ChangeSet which encapsulates the delta between two versions of a resource description.  In this context a resource description is the set of triples that in some way comprise a description of a resource.  The delta is represented by two sets of triples: additions and removals.  A ChangeSet can be used to modify a resource description by first removing all triples from the description that are in the removals set and adding the triples in the additions set.",
