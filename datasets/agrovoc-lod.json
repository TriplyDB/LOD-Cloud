It is widely used in specialized libraries as well as digital libraries and repositories to index content and for the purpose of text mining.  It is also used as a specialized tagging resource for content organization by FAO and third-party stakeholders.\n\nThis dataset is AGROVOC LOD.  It includes:\n - [AGROVOC Core](/fao/agrovoc-core)\n- pointer to `void:inDataset` triple, linking to the [AGROVOC VoID descriptor](/fao/agrovoc-void), for each `skos:Concept`, `skosxl:Label` and `skos:ConceptScheme`\n- materialization of SKOS core labels from the [skosxl](/w3c/skosxl) reified Labels ([skosxl](/w3c/skosxl) Labels are maintained too)\n- materializaton of trivially inferred triples (due to symmetric and `inverseOf` properties, no transitive closure computed)\n- Agrontology vocabulary (stored in the `<http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrontology>` named graph)",
