  "description": "ISO 19111-2:2009 specifies the conceptual schema for the description of spatial referencing using parametric values or functions.  It applies the schema of ISO 19111 to combine a position referenced by coordinates with a parametric value to form a spatio‑parametric coordinate reference system (CRS).  The spatio‑parametric CRS can optionally be extended to include time.\n\nThe intended users of ISO 19111-2:2009 are producers and users of environmental information.\n\nParameters which are attributes of spatial locations or features, but which are not involved in their spatial referencing, are not addressed by ISO 19111-2:2009.",
