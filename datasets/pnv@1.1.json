  "description": "The Person Name Vocabulary (PNV) is an rdf vocabulary and data model for persons' names. It is applicable to many datasets in which persons are described, as it accommodates different levels of data granularity. It furthermore allows for easy alignment of name elements, including idiosyncratic ones, such as family name prefixes and patronymics, with standard vocabularies such as schema.org, foaf, DBpedia and Wikidata, thus guaranteeing optimal data interoperability.",
