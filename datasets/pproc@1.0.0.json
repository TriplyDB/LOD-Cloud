  "description": "The PPROC ontology defines the necessary concepts to describe public procurement process and the contracts of public sector (public e-procurement).  The ontology has been designed with the main purpose of publishing data about public contracts.  This ontology extends the [Public Contracts Ontology](https://code.google.com/p/public-contracts-ontology/), an ontology developed by the czech Open Data initiative.  The development of this ontology was part of the CONTSEM project (TSI-020606-2012-4), led by [iASoft](http://www.iasoft.es) ([OESIA](http://www.oesia.com/en/home)).",
