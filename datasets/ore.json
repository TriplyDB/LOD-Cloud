This document describes a glossary of terms and the vocabularies needed to describe items of interest and express the relationships between them within the OAI-ORE context.\n\nThis specification is one of several documents comprising the [OAI-ORE specifications and user guides](http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/toc).  Readers who want a high-level understanding of the motivation for ORE, and of the solution it provides, should read the [Primer](http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/primer).",
