  "description": "Provides a specification of simple data types such as enumerations and codelists.  These are needed in support of the conversion of XML Schemas and UML Models to [OWL](/w3c/owl).  The purpose of *dtype* is to provide a foundation for expressing rich data types.  These data types are typically needed when dealing with OWL representations of data structures derived from XML Schema.",
