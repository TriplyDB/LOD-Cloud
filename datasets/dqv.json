  "description": "The Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) provides a framework in which the quality of a dataset can be described, whether by the dataset publisher or by a broader community of users.  It does not provide a formal, complete definition of quality, rather, it sets out a consistent means by which information can be provided such that a potential user of a dataset can make his/her own judgment about its fitness for purpose.",
