# Too little information

This directory contains dataset descriptions that are incomplete.
This happens when datasets are found online or are reused in other
datasets, but not all of the metadata has yet been found.

If you have more information about such a dataset, please consider
creating a [pull request](https://github.com/TriplyDB/YALC/pulls).

## Missing namespaces

There are some namespaces that are used in order datasets, for which
no dataset could yet be found.  Please open a ‘Dataset request’
[issue](https://github.com/TriplyDB/YALC/issues) if you know which
dataset defines any of the following namespaces:
