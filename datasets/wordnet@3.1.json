  "description": "WordNet is a large lexical database of English.  Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept.  Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations.  The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated with the browser.  WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing.",
