  "description": "Welcome to Mind Informatics, a platform where we make transdisciplinary inquiries into the mind’s internal information processing structure.  It's a platform where we discuss the relationship between information, computer science, and the mind.  As an interdisciplinary concept that mind informatics is, we provide information, tips, materials, and resources as they relate to several areas of study.\n\nHere on Mind Informatics, we examine the conceptual and theoretical aspects of the human mind’s science.  We believe that making continued progress in understanding how the mind works depends on discovering new methods to organize and process an ever-developing body of information.",
