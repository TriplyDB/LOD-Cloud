  "description": "Our goal is to build an open data infrastructure in the Czech Republic.  It will provide public data to anyone at any time and allow data to be freely combined.  Based on easy access to data, the professional public can freely and independently create applications for both other professionals and the general public.  An example is the Click-through Budget application.",
