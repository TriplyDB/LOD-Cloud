  "description": "The Brick Consortium, Inc. is a non-profit membership corporation whose purpose is to encourage the research and development of Brick Schema Specifications for the built environment and any supporting tooling, documentation, and best practices necessary to promote Brick.  The consortium develops the Brick Schema Specifications as open source through member participation.\n\nThe consortium, through the Brick schema, addresses an important industry and societal need by helping to make data of the built environment interoperable.  The consortium is made up of researchers, technology providers, integrators, and building operators, and will serve as an organization that can provide the long-term support necessary to maintain and enhance the Brick schema until 2040 and beyond.  The consortium provides governance for the Brick Schema specifications and conformance testing protocols, and provides tooling and a repository of reference models and canonical use cases.  The consortium also funds the research of work related to Brick and the built environment and works to evangelize the use of the Brick schema.\n\nThe consortium is committed to ensuring the Brick specification is not encumbered with proprietary intellectual property.\n\nThe [rules of the consortium](https://brickschema.org/docs/Brick_Membership_Rules_Jan_25_2021.pdf) are available for review, as is a [membership form](https://brickschema.org/docs/Brick_membership_form_feb_2021.pdf).  We hosted a virtual open house in 2021, and the [video and slides are available](https://brickschema.org/blog/brick-consortium-virtual-kickoff).",
