  "description": "Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010, and since that time Oracle's hardware and software engineers have worked side-by-side to build fully integrated systems and [optimized solutions](https://www.oracle.com/solutions/optimized-solutions/) designed to achieve performance levels that are unmatched in the industry.  Early examples include the [Oracle Exadata Database Machine X2-8](https://www.oracle.com/engineered-systems/exadata/), and the first [Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/engineered-systems/exalogic/), both introduced in late 2010.  During 2011, Oracle introduced the SPARC SuperCluster T4-4, a general-purpose, engineered system with [Oracle Solaris](https://www.oracle.com/solaris/solaris11/) that delivered record-breaking performance on a series of enterprise benchmarks.  Oracle's SPARC-based systems are some of the most scalable, reliable, and secure products available today.  Sun's prized software portfolio has continued to develop as well, with new releases of [Oracle Solaris](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/solaris/solaris11/overview/), [MySQL](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/mysql/overview/), and the recent introduction of [Java 7](https://www.oracle.com/java/).  Oracle invests in innovation by designing hardware and software systems that are engineered to work together.",
