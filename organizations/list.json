In all of our daily routines from waking up in the morning to closing our eyes in the evening, the web makes our daily routine a little bit easier.  To be more precise, we take action, talk, and get information on the web.  We all produce and distribute information on the web every day.  The web is a huge information repository and platform composed of information produced in this way.  In addition, through the connection of information and information, the web has developed and will continue to develop.",
